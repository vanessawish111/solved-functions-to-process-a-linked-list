This program will define various functions to process a linked list. The main program will demonstrate that the functions work.

Input: An input file contains an unknown number of integers. Use a createList function to create the list with the integers in the info component of each list node.

Output: Use a printList function to output the info component of each list node.

Other functions are:

findMin

This function returns a pointer to the node which has the minimum info value.

addLastThis function asks the user to input an integer, and inserts a new node containing that integer at the end of the list.

addFirstThis function asks the user to input an integer, and inserts a new node containing that integer at the beginning of the list.

deleteMaxThis function locates the node with the maximum info value, and deletes it from the list.

sortListAscendingThis function sorts the list so the integers in the info components of the nodes are in ascending order.

addInOrderThis function gets an integer from the user, and inserts a node containing that integer into its proper place in a list which is sorted in ascending order. (This function is not allowed to call the sortListAscending function!)
